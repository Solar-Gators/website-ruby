        Our team was originally founded in 2012 with goals of racing in the summer of 2014.<br /> <br />A new group of UF students inherited the vestiges in the fall of 2016 with a goal of racing the following summer and did not fully realize their goals until a large donation from a sponsor six weeks out from competition.
